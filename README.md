# code-challenges

This repository is for the start of my CS journey, specifically algorithms and code challenges. It's been many years since I've taken math courses, with a statistics and college algebra class being the most recent back around 2003. Long forgotten memories include a calculus class taken in highschool. 

### While learning CS (phase 2 of Vets Who Code) I hope to...
+ Be able to solve daily code challenges.
+ Increase my chances of solving interview challenge questions. 
+ Exercise my brain and think more like a programmer.
+ Improve my overall problem sovling skills.
+ Level up.
